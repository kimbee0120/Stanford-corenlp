Coronavirus,1,"""I'm sure you know all this, but I'm going to say it: The threat profile of a virus is about more than its fatality rate. It's about how the virus operates inside the cell, how it is transmitted, whether it can be nebulized into the air through cough or vomit, how long it survives outside the body and at what temperature, whether it can vector through other species, and so on.\n\nFurther, there are the non-biological dimensions; how quickly authorities respond, how quickly a vaccine can be developed, which communities it reaches, how the population reacts, and so on. For example, infection of medical personnel can compound the problem drastically, resulting in quarantines, hospital shutdowns, staff shortages, etc. Also, the fact that this is happening during Chinese New Years, with its associated travel, means that we will not really know the outlay of this virus until the consequence of that plays out.\n\nFor example, there were 770 deaths from SARS. If, for example, the claims of the Wuhan doctor in the most recent viral video were correct--that there are already 90,000 cases of 2019-nCoV--then with a 3% mortality rate, that would be \\~2,700 deaths expected. And if it truly were 90,000 cases, then things are only going to get much worse.\n\nThis higher estimate of 90,000 cases is as yet unsubstantiated, but may fit with other reports coming out that the first cases of 2019-nCoV were actually in early December, and the officially reported December 31st date is just CCP narrative.\n\nAll this to say, I wouldn't be so cavalier.""",2020-01-25-08

Coronavirus,1,'With a novel coronavirus there is no treatment and no vaccine.  \n\nNO VACCINE! \n\nMake sense now',2020-01-25-17
Coronavirus,1,"'Its killed some old people, just like SARS and H1N1 did, there was no vaccine for either of them either and absolutely fuck all happened apart from a few hundred old people dying which happens from multiple different viruses every day. I got H1N1 when I was on holiday and my family freaked out when I told them and thought I was going to die, but it was literally just like regular flu, I felt ill for 2-3 days then I was fine. I was kept in quarantine that whole time and nobody was allowed to come into my room without a hazmat suit cos I was the first person in Greece to get infected and the doctors also freaked out.\n\nThis happens every couple of years and people get excited and like to pretend its the end of the world because it makes them feel good in some weird perverse way, this is absolutely no different to the 15 last times we had a new ""killer virus"" that the media whipped us up into a frenzy about.'",2020-01-25-17

Coronavirus,1,"'This post is coughing me.\n\nJokes aside. The corona is spreading over 3 continents in 1 month and I never seen a city with population larger than my whole home country evacuated before in my life, because of virus. I know it is a wired by default by the survival instinct to be worried about thinks that could go wrong, but if mathemativly there is a chance that all cities with 2-3 cases may turn into exactly like this chinese town in the next 1 month, it may be too late to act. Also on youtube they say it will take ""1 year in the best case scenario"", to develop a possible vaccine. The adults will survive most likely, but what about our parents or children?'",2020-01-25-21
Coronavirus,1,"""Id say all points are true in a way.\n\nIt is being sensationalised- that is the bread and butter of the media, plus there are people both on the side of the Chinese government and against them who wish to use this for their own advantage.\n\nProper measures are being taken, which is to say the very limited resources any authority can keep on hand for such an event are being used but won't make much of a difference.\n\nIt is definitely beyond containment given how it has behaved to date. Blockading cities will only slow it down, which will do some good in spreading the impact over time somewhat and buying time for a possible vaccine to be rolled out (though it will likely be poorly tested and will have its own potential negative impacts).\n\nIt is much worse than reported, not for its impact in terms of fatalities (apparently about 3 % of the 5 % of people that show enough symptoms to go to hospital, so about the same as measles but much less infectious and probably with less gnarly long term side effects). It also seems to mostly kill old and ill people, so that economic impact will be lessened there (and may even produce an economic benefit once the dust settles). The economic impacts of the morbidity and of measures to stop the spread may be the worst aspects of the disease. Shutting down large cities doesnt happen without its own costs. Kind of like amputating your arm to stop cooties spreading from your fingers.""",2020-01-25-22
