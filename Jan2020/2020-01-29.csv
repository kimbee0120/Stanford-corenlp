Coronavirus,1,"""Sorry, I should clarify what those projections were describing.\n\nSpecifically, the part you highlighted are the numbers we might see if the scenario I described, initially, came about (we lose control of the outbreak, and it becomes a cyclical and global infection like the flu and the common cold).  If that were to happen, those would indeed be the annual deaths we would see assuming the virus were to reach steady-state, and the vaccination rate against the virus is the same as the vaccination rate we see for the present-day flu (roughly 50%).\n\nThe initial wave, in the scenario where we lost control of the outbreak, would be dramatically worse than steady-state, since the first round of infection we would have no vaccine against.  In that case, we might see numbers an order of magnitude worse.\n\nIn any case, I wasn't trying to freak anybody out.  OP wanted to know why people were already freaking out (50 million quarantined in China, 20 US airports monitoring incoming travelers, White House considering banning inbound flights from China) when nobody really seems to care about the flu or the common cold, and these hypothetical numbers are why.\n\nBear in mind, the flu as it is today is an absolute tragedy.  Despite it being completely preventable, since the rise of the anti-vax movement (sorry to make this political?), it's become one of the leading causes of death in the US, and that's only because things like heart disease and cancer are actually groups of a whole host of different ailments that get added up together.\n\nI'll take this moment to say, in the unlikely event that this new coronavirus outbreak actually does get out of control, the best thing you could do right now to protect your future self is to get your flu shot.  If you were to get the regular-old flu during a coronavirus outbreak, and you end up having to go to any sort of medical center for treatment, the odds of catching the coronavirus in the waiting room or a hospital bed is way higher than if you just got your flu shot and went around your daily business.""",2020-01-29-01

Id say were the first among equals  although my colleagues might not like that.""\n\nWatching monkey kidneys at 3am\nOn Friday a man in his 50s, who was visiting from China and had respiratory symptoms, was brought into the Monash Medical Centre at Clayton. Within hours, a nose swab was under the microscope at the Doherty.\n\nThe first step was to check the virus\' genetic code. By 2.15am on Saturday the team had it  and it was a perfect match for the Wuhan coronavirus.\n\nAs the announcement of Australias first case of coronavirus reverberated around the nation, the team were already onto the next step: trying to grow the virus in a flask.\n\nThis was a far more difficult challenge, but crucial. A live virus allows other researchers to develop more effective tests for it.\n\n""Its a key step in the development of vaccines,"" says Dr Catton.\n\nLabs around the world had tried without success to do it. The Chinese have grown a sample but have not yet shared it with the international community.\n\nBut the Doherty had been preparing for this for years.\n\nMany viruses are fussy, and will grow only in a certain type of cell. The labs freezers house a huge collection of cells from humans and animals. Among them is the institutes secret weapon: a line of monkey-kidney cells.\n\n""This particular monkey cell line is almost the best cell line there is, because it just grows so many viruses,"" says Dr Julian Druce, head of the Dohertys virus identification lab.\n\nDr Catton says: ""Its an art, and Julian is the artist.""\n\nMaterial from the infected man was placed in a flask filled with a layer of monkey cells. The Dohertys lab is extremely secure, so the easiest way for the scientists to watch their test was via a video camera on top of the flask. Many team members would get up at night to watch the camera feed online.\n\n""That was a bit of fun,"" says Dr Catton. ""If youre into that sort of thing  I guess maybe we need to get out more.""\n\nThe researchers watched the cells. If they died, it was a sign the coronavirus was active.\n\nVision released by the institute shows the transparent cells turning black  a few at first, and then more and more until the dish is filled with death.\n\nThe living virus will now be used to develop an ""antibody test"", which can tell if someone has coronavirus even if they are not showing symptoms. That will allow authorities to work out the true scale of the outbreak.\n\nThe Doherty will also sequence its genes so it can be properly compared with other cases in China, allowing it to work out if the virus is mutating.\n\nAnd when enough copies of the virus have grown in the monkey cells, they will be ""harvested"" and sent to other labs around Australia and the world including CSIRO researchers who are hoping to give animals the virus to test potential treatments.'",2020-01-29-05

With the flu, its expected, it happens every year, we already have vaccines that mitigate the issue. \n\nThere are two main concerns with this virus that make it different. \n\nFirst, we do not have a vaccine. That means everyone is susceptible, as far as we know. Imagine if the flu happened for the first time and no one was vaccinated against its spread. In 2012 the vaccine had an estimated efficacy of 67%. 45% of the population was vaccinated in 2012. Flu related deaths from 2010 to 2016 were 12k to 56k. So about half the people someone with the flu virus encountered were vaccinated and 2/3 of those people would have been protected (I think thats how it would work?). With coronavirus, every single person that comes into contact with the virus could potentially get infected. That means it will spread more easily. \n\nSecond, the incubation period from infection to showing symptoms is anywhere from a week to two weeks. It appears that the virus is contagious before symptoms show (not sure what the specific timeline is).  That means infected individuals will be in public with freedom of mobility and the potential to travel long distances before any precautions are taken. \n\nAs it stands, it is currently a big question mark. Its an emergency in China and a serious concern elsewhere. Its not necessarily worse than the flu, but because of the above two points has the potential to spread more easily and infect more people.'",2020-01-29-12

Coronavirus,1,"""Sorry if this is is too long, but there are LOADS of reasons why this virus is *potentionally* scary not mentioned by previous commenters.\n\nThe primary reason is that this virus is new (hence the name *novel* coronavirus) and we don't know anything about it, which brings about the 3 following issues:\n\n1. We don't have a large enough sample size or time frame to know how deadly or infectious the virus really is, nor how it will mutate in the future. In fact, we don't even entirely know *how* or *when* someone with the virus can infect others nor how those factors are affected by climate. The fatality rate is only *speculated* to be 2% (it's literally just the official dead divided by total official infected) but in reality we have no clue because by far the majority of the people known to have the virus are still sick and there are more patients than the hospitals can handle. We do know most confirmed cases seem to only have mild symptoms, but in around *20%* of those cases the virus is causing kidney failure and/or extreme breathing difficulty, which means the fatality rate could still easily increase by a very large margin. So please don't listen to anyone claiming 'it's just like a flu' because not only is a 2% fatality rate already worse than the flu, but that number isn't even accurate in the first place. It can range from 0.1% - 25%. \n\n2. Because the virus is yet to be examined, there is no vaccine and it will take at least a year before one could become publically available, so if we underestimate the virus and are careless enough to let it turn into a global pandemic, all we can do for the people infected is relieve their symptoms(painkillers, oxygen, ventilation and organ support), which practically boils down to entirely relying on your immune system to fight it off and if that fails, you're done for. \n\nThe second huge reason is that (as mentioned in previous comments) this is happening *during flu season*, the symptoms of which are very similar to that of the coronavirus. That means a lot of people *without* the virus are getting infected by flooding hospitals along with people who do have the virus simply because the symptoms are hard to distinguish. \n\nThere's a whole bunch of other reasons as well. Another big one is that the virus could possibly spread during incubation which makes it nigh impossible to contain, there's the huge amount of people in the affected area that have travelled abroad, there's the (at least to some extent) dishonest reports by the Chinese government, the lack of resources to get a clear picture on the number of infected, the fact that the virus has been around for a month or two before serious measures were taken, etc. etc.\n\nSo yeah, it's totally justified to be concerned, but that's not to say it will end the world. For all we know it could end up being harmless, but we have to play it safe just in case.""",2020-01-29-17
Coronavirus,1,"""5-10% is likely the official number we're being told. There is reason to be concerned, but panicking won't help anyone. The best we can do us stock up of essential supplies and masks until a vaccine is made available.\n\nI have heard anecdotes of antiviral medicine like those used for HIV being successful in helping treat the virus, they are testing them at the moment so we'll have to see.""",2020-01-29-18

I give it 1 or 2 weeks for a free for all over there.

Coronavirus,1,""" July 2015, two patent applications are filed by the  Pirbright Institute. They claim novel strains of attenuated coronavirus  which can be used to create vaccines for respiratory diseases like  bronchitis. The patent specifically mentions utilizing the vaccine for  livestock. Please note; neither of these patents are publicly available  at this time, so the only people who will know of it at this time are  the folks at Pirbright, their investors, and the folks at the USPTO.  \n\\&gt;August  of 2017, one of the applications is published. Highly unusual for it to  take two years for a patent application to be published, but I assume  when you're dealing with diseases it has to go through security review  or something.
