Coronavirus,1,"""To be fair there's life 3000 types of flus and the person who makes the vaccine has to look at what came before to see how it's evolving and hope it doesn't get a weird mutation once the vaccine is done""",2020-01-24-00
Coronavirus,1,"'It will take months to create a vaccine for this. There is three important things we need to know in order to create a vaccine: Transmission, Origin, &amp; Severity. We do not know any of these. We can only treat it for now and hopefully make a nice recovery.'",2020-01-24-07
Coronavirus,1,"""The pharmacietical companies are working on a vaccine. It will make them millions.  As I understand most is grown using eggs. My guess is 16 weeks for a vaccine. Now this virus is rapidly mutating. So will the vaccine work if it mutates to a new strain? I do know this, once any virus can jump from humans to human without some other animal in between it is a concern. It is the mutating part that bothers me. Yes today it is killing old people but one change in it's make up and guess what? Then it could mutate into something completely harmless.""",2020-01-24-08
Coronavirus,1,"""They have to make the vaccine first, the earliest numbers I've heard put it at a year for total discovery plus production and delivery. \n\nIn a years time, will the vaccine work?""",2020-01-24-08
Coronavirus,1,"""an attenuated virus is a virus that has been changed on purpose to be weaker in order to be used in a vaccine. It is very common to patent the particular kind of change and the particular kind of virus that that change makes. Because that patent is used in developing vaccines so of course they want to protect it.\n\nI have seen this going around as a conspiracy theory because of the WARS novel virus. It's a silly one. Anyone who's going to weaponize of virus with definitely not attenuate it.""",2020-01-24-14
Coronavirus,1,"""I understand it's probably a difficult job to make a flu vaccine, but facts are still good and I was interested to learn that over many of the past flu seasons, the shot was less than 40%, effective.""",2020-01-24-14
Coronavirus,1,"""I don't think antivaxxers deny the existence of viruses, so much as they think the vaccine is riskier than the disease.""",2020-01-24-16
Coronavirus,1,"""The purpose of the patent is for vaccines, isn't it. So they can create a future vaccine of a similar virus""",2020-01-24-17
Coronavirus,1,"'Yeah, but youre forgetting that the more the virus spreads the more medical equipment will be bought and the more funding for a vaccine there will be. Meaning more money for biotech and the pharmaceutical companies, In the US biotech only makes up 1% of the US economy, but US pharmaceutical firms make up 45% of the global pharmaceutical market, meaning if theres a global pandemic there will be huge profits for US pharmaceutical companies.\n\nAlso another economic benefit (less important of course) is that gas prices will drop because of a lack of demand for international travel as the outbreak worsens ( just like we saw today). Also according to a report on the Economic Effects of the Spanish Flu, by the St. Louis Fed, that states who had the highest number of deaths during that outbreak, had the highest rate of per capital income growth following the outbreak.  Probably because with a scarcity of workers, the ones who survived the illness could demand more salary.\n\nSo there are some benefits to a global pandemic, and the people who would stand to profit are the biotech firms, pharmaceutical firms, and the survivors of the pandemic.'",2020-01-24-18
Coronavirus,1,"""It's a gamble though, we don't know how fast the vaccine will be found, that's why I had that idea, imagine if it went for like... 1-2 month? people may slip through and spread the disease to a new country ( and infection number can reach to thousands sadly) so in both situations, you lose money, however, you can still save citizens by blocking borders""",2020-01-24-18
Coronavirus,1,"'Nah, you dont make a bio weapon with out a prevention/treatment strategy for your own. Youd likely see a new antiviral in use or a brand new use of a new vaccine entering trials in China.'",2020-01-24-21
Coronavirus,1,'The good news is a successful prior vaccine can roadmap a new vaccine for similar viruses. Can make development significantly faster.',2020-01-24-21
Coronavirus,1,"""I was just looking for some other info on it.  I haven't heard much on it really at all yet, nor have I really read up much on it yet on account of wroming my ass off lately.  Just seen this link being tossed around a bit.  I'm not too well versed on vaccine and disease/virus terminology.  I just thought this would be the best place for an answer. \n\nAlso I don't use Twitter, but thanks for your kind words!""",2020-01-24-21
Coronavirus,1,'I just read thru a bunch of comments from anti vaxxers on a Facebook post and they believe the virus was spread by Bill Gates in order to mandate a vaccine to the entire world population. I am not shitting you.',2020-01-24-22
