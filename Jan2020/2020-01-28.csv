Coronavirus,1,"""hey there! Im a public health epidemiologist and I am here to help! If you are a healthy individual who is considered by your physician **not** to be immune compromised, you are fully capable of fighting this virus off. You would be surprised but learning more about viruses will help mitigate your anxiety. That is where I come in. I have posted in more detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/etmbmi/perceptions_from_an_epidemiologist_on_ncov_2019/). In short, viruses have an incubation period, which is the time from a person contracts a virus to the time they first start to show symptoms. During that time, the virus will usually remain subclinical meaning that it is working away in the background, trying to enter your cells and change their DNA. When your body starts to show symptoms, that is because it has recognized that something is not right with how your body and cells are functioning. Coughing and sneezing are a natural biological function triggered by your immune system to expel foreign agents. Unfortunately for viruses, by the time you start coughing and sneezing,  it has already begun doing its damage. \n\nNow to keep yourself protected, the virus is spread via droplet on saliva projectiles with you sneeze or cough. It is also transferred on hard surfaces and through touching others. That said any sort of mask to cover your face will do just fine. There are a lot of people talking about N95's and full face shields but these are only truly necessary for health care professionals working in close proximity to infected patients. This is because they often have to provide oxygen and other gases that take those droplets and nebulize them into smaller particles. As a person in the general public (I assume), to reduce exposure to and transmission of a range of illnesses, including coronaviruses, you should follow usual health precautions such as:\n\n* washing your hands often\n* avoiding contact with people who are sick\n* practising proper cough and sneeze etiquette (sneezing into your elbow and washing your hands afterwards)\n\nThere are no specific treatments for coronaviruses, and there is no vaccine that protects against coronaviruses. Most people with common human coronavirus illness will recover on their own.\n\nIf symptoms feel worse than a standard cold, see your health care practitioner. They can relieve symptoms by prescribing a pain or fever medication.\n\nYou should also:\n\n* drink plenty of fluids\n* get rest and sleep as much as possible\n* try a humidifier or a hot shower to help with a sore throat or cough""",2020-01-28-09

Well at the risk of being called an a anti-science believer:\nOne, the number of longer-term injuries it causes, although to be correct I guess due to the fact that they do not actually keep track of it and can say 'there is not evidence to suggest...' In fact it was suggested to at the WHO vaccine safety conference, that they START looking at the long term effects in order to address vaccine hesitency.  Secondly they can spout that it is safe and effective when they haven't provided safety studies mandated to the HHS since 1987 and when there is evidence of vaccine failure yet they continue to blame 'antivaxxers' for various outbreaks...Just a couple of examples.

Coronavirus,1,"""Of course it's a possibility. Anything is possible. However, the likelihood of it being a bioweapon is just about 0%. \n\nFirst of all, bioweapons are meant to *kill* the *enemy*, while not harming yourself. Meaning, that a good bioweapon is something you already have a vaccine for, and which will have a high mortality rate. If it can cause permanent injury, even better.\n\nThis is why smallpox is an example of a great bioweapon. Why do you think neither the US nor the Soviet Union ever wanted to give it up? If you want to use it, first vaccinate your population, then get it on the enemy. The enemy will be unprepared, and thousands or millions of people will either die and get disfiguring injuries before enough vaccine is made to prevent it from spreading.\n\nCoronavirus is much more like the common cold. It has a high rate of transmission (which is bad for China) and a low mortality rate. It does not leave any disfiguring injuries. And, there's no vaccine for it. If it's a bioweapon, it's the *worst* bioweapon in history.\n\nAlso, the fact that it's **extremely similar** to a virus found naturally in bats makes those bats a much more likely culprit than the bioweapons lab accidentally losing a worthless cold virus *in a seafood market.*""",2020-01-28-18
