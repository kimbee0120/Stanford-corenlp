Coronavirus,1,"'If youre 15, you probably have a very healthy immune system and are among those least likely to be affected.\n\nI think the virus is worse than is being reported, but that doesnt mean you should think of it as a meteor about to hit earth, either. There are simple, common sense things that you can do; wash your hands thoroughly, and avoid crowded areas/use a basic mask if you have to be in close proximity to people. The people who say thats pointless are wrong; its not perfect, but it definitely helps.\n\nIn all likelihood, in the west right now, and especially for you, even something basic like a mask is probably not necessary. I think at this point its reasonable to be on high alert just to prevent it spreading to the extent thats possible, but mostly to prevent it reaching older people.\n\nRegardless of how bad it is (and keep in mind theres a LOT of information that is still unknown/its hard to figure out the truth of any of this stuff), its important to keep a level head.\n\nFull transparency of where Im at, personally; Im staying pretty isolated, but Im not wearing a mask or anything on the few occasions when I go out. I have one if I need to go somewhere crowded/high risk like an airport or hospital. I recommended an older family member who works in a city to consider wearing a facemask now when hes using public transportation, just as a precaution.\n\nWell know more by the end if the week. If the cases in the US dont start rising in a J curve like in China by the end of the week, were ok. Until then, Id bring hand sanitizer to school and wash your hands thoroughly when you can, try not to put your hands all over desks and then on your face or anything, and try not to get too close to anyone. If they do start rising exponentially here too, dont panic; again, youre low risk, and though its deadlier than the flu, I believe the deadly cases are still mostly older people. The death rate could be higher than 2%, but it could also be lower. We wont know until time passes to allow more people to fully recover.\n\nKeep in mind its reported there was a big banquet in Wuhan during the lunar new year where 100,00 people were eating from shared plates, people were close to each other during festivities, its possible the virus affects asians more, no one was quarantined until well after it was found, etc; so even if the virus is 100x worse in China right now than being reported, that doesnt necessarily mean the west is going to get nearly as bad.\n\nSo, in conclusion; we dont really know if its a threat, and it could be nbd for most people. Either way theres no good in freaking out. Theres reason to be alert and take precautions, sure, but we just kind of have to wait and see if this is overblown.'",2020-01-30-00

Coronavirus,1,"'I translated most of it but before you begin to read all this, let me just say, this was just a way of him demonstrating how misinformation is spread throughout media. Nothing in this post is true.\n\nToday\'s post will surprise you. You will say that I have gone crazy, but I have thought about it long before writing this. Please read it until the end, I am putting links for you to see that I do not lie. And share it, please, let the truth come out. It\'s about the coronavirus. Inside thread\nYou know that I travel a lot. For work, I go to China a lot: there is the largest video game market in the world. At least every summer I go to ChinaJoy, the largest game fair in the world, in Shanghai. There is a picture of me so you can see that it is serious. As I go a lot, I know the country well. I have been to Wuhan many times, it is 4 hours by train from Shanghai. Upon leaving Hankou station is the Huanan Wet Market. The typical thing is what they call wild flavor (ye wei,  in Chinese), and you can find everything from foxes to snakes or beavers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huanan_Seafood_Wholesale_Market ...). There arose the Coronavirus. From what Chinese friends tell me, it was a fish stand, which sold snake, which is used to make soup (photo below). The rest you already know. Let\'s change the subject. Suppose I tell you that last year, after half a century of failure, China abolished the one-child policy. As you know, China has an overpopulation problem (1.5 billion people). The one-child policy did not stop the population. As you can see in the graph, that policy was only a facade, and the population rose. With the arrival of well-being, China is urgently needed to reduce its population, to be less and richer. Either way. I go back to Wuhan. It is one of the 3 ovens, the three hottest cities in China (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Furnaces). The ideal environment for a virus. Being central, the capitals of China (Shanghai, Beijing, Chongking and Guangdong) are 4 hours away by train. Clearly, a virus that appeared in Wuhan would run like gunpowder: it is a city the size of New York, with stifling weather, and trains that connect it with the whole country. Only the spark that does this unstoppable is missing. A market? No: the infection would be too limited. Do you know what is also in Wuhan? The largest bioterrorism laboratory in China. Ok, now you think I\'ve gone crazy. But keep reading, please. To start, read this: This is their website: http://english.whiov.cas.cn. Well, let\'s continue: do you know who runs this lab? Shi Zheng Li. Surely it doesn\'t sound like you. But if I tell you who identified the SARS virus of 2003? http://chinadaily.com.cn/a/201712/07/WS5a288e90a310fcb6fafd2a17.html Remember that the 2003 SARS ""only"" caused a mortality of 10%. It helped stop it is that its incubation was short (4-6 days, similar to the flu). That made the virus could be contained. It is what is called R0: how many people infect a patient. In SARS, R0 is 3. The Coronavirus is much more screwed: it has a silent incubation period of 14 days, which makes it presuppose a much greater R0. For now, WHO is not getting wet, but they are trying to calculate it. The 2003 SARS appeared in Guangdong, 4 hours by train south of Wuhan. Another hot and overpopulated region. Another ideal place to launch a virus and reduce the population. And you will think: fuck, if this were true, the rest of the world would have done something about it. Did. If China wants to charge its own, it is your problem. Well, virologists from around the world worked to contain the SARS. That\'s why he stopped. There Carlo Urbani stands out, who is the one who warned WHO of what was being cooked, and helped stop it. I tell you what happened to him? Urbani died of SARS, in Bangkok. A disease that I knew perfectly, and that only had a mortality of 10%. Weird, no? It seems as if someone wanted to get rid of who could reveal the secret and stop the virus: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Urbani Do not you believe me? And if I tell you that Coronavirus has a vaccine? Developed in its day to contain the SARS, once it left China. And ready to act this time. Here you have it: https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/31/23/d0/e63e0adde2fbad/US10130701.pdf That vaccine has been developed among others by the Pirbright Institute, which are the ones that once loaded the Plague Bovine, so they know what they are talking about. Will they give this vaccine to the Chinese? I really doubt it. I am implying that China is trying to burden its population, and that the world is preparing for when the disease crosses its borders? Yes, and I am not the only one. If I\'m SO crazy, why does the Times say so? https://go.shr.lc/38J7yPD. And it\'s not the first time. I tell you: In 2008 you will remember the case of poisoned baby milk, which caused 300,000 victims (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Chinese_milk_scandal). None of this should surprise you. But what I am going to tell you now is what is going to really hallucinate you: I have invented everything. EVERYTHING. It took me 90 minutes to prepare this post with short and paste Internet news. I have not been to Wuhan in my life, and obviously. With this post I wanted to demonstrate one thing: how easy it is to cheat in the era of informational overdose. Just choose facts carefully, omit key information, and create a credible appearance. Another day I disassemble the thread explaining all the tricks.

Coronavirus,1,"""&gt;am I missing something here? Why is there so much panic and response to this when the death rate is still a reported 2%?\n\nI did explain that in the text of this post.\n\nThat 2% figure is very misleading and will significantly underplay the true figure by virtue of how it's calculated.\n\nIt compares current deaths to current infected. But can't you see the big red flag there? How many of those current infected are yet to even go through the death stage? So how can you just divide dead by infected to state the fatality rate when we don't know how many of those current  infected will die? I explain all this in the post but the upshot is that the true fatality rate could be closer to 14%.\n\nThen you need to factor in the growth rate of this disease. You'll have to look for it yourself but another redditor in this subreddit has posted a graph comparing this outbreak with Sars and one other. This outbreak is the only one where the infection rate is increasing exponentially. Both of the other two had a roughly linear infection growth rate. An exponential infection is deeply worrying because firstly it means the virus isn't contained, a secondly it shows that the virus is spreading easily and accelerating.\n\nThat coupled with the potentially much higher fatality rate could mean if humanity doesn't stop this thing soon, in just two months we could be looking at 100s of millions of dead. That is a very real scenario but equally one where a lot of factors could mitigate this worst case scenario: a vaccine, quarantine, reducing the spread of movement of people. But then those things themselves bring other problems like reduced flow of goods such as food.\n\nThe critical juncture, as I see it, will be this:\n\nHas the virus taken hold outside of China?\n\nIf it has, even at a point where there are just a handful of cases of infection from people that had never been to China, then this will get very bad. Once the virus is out in the open across the world, it is going to spread relentlessly. If we reach that stage then we pin all our hopes on a vaccine or a lot of people going about their daily lives right now, unaware, are going to be dead in two months time.\n\nWhy two months? Because the virus is currently showing an increase of infected at about 25% growth / day. That means, mathematically, by the end of two months everyone on the planet will have been infected. It won't be like that in real life with quarantining and pockets that are slower to get infected but either way, in the second month, it'll take hold rapidly and many many people will die.\n\nAnd all this is without even touching on what might happen if this virus mutates. When the Spanish Flu mutated, it went from unpleasant to utterly devastatingly deadly.\n\nSo yes, there is plenty to be concerned about. But there is plenty to be optimistic about too. We're an advanced society with the ability to rapidly identify vaccines. Our global communications are way more advance than the days of the Spanish Flu and we can coordinate action to try and minimise the impact. So let's be optimistic whilst being ready to take the necessary personal safety steps should things start to get out of hand. But critically, let's not be naive.""",2020-01-30-02

Coronavirus,1,"'Biotechnologist here (though my genetic knowledge is a bit rusty!).\n\nThe picture of one paragraph is saying the genome of the Wuhan coronavirus (basically the virus\'s DNA - its genes and what proteins they say to make) was uploaded by Chinese researchers to GenBank (a major genetics database used by scientists to share information). This is very useful because from there it can be cross-referenced to other viruses in the database, compared with DNA from samples in other parts of the world, etc. Knowing what sort of proteins the virus is making can also help vaccine development. It then says that the uploaded genome was changed by the Chinese researchers ""for unknown reasons"" and ""without notice"". The photo seems to think this is suspicious and a deliberate obfuscation of information. I haven\'t checked what was changed myself, but it might not be malicious - genomes are often edited as better information is gathered. They could be correcting a mistake or adding extra information that wasn\'t clear before. I can\'t say either way, but the paragraph claims they changed the wrong information.\n\nAnother picture (the ""brief summary"") says that between 2017-2019, a SARS-like coronavirus was identified in bats by some Chinese researchers, primarily the Chinese military.\n\n  \n\n\nThe last picture shows two of these SARS-like bat virus genomes in GenBank, while claiming that only the military owned these viruses and that they identified they were a possible infection risk for humans.

We don\'t really know what the death rate, and the recovery rate, and won\'t for probably another week or so.  The acute respiratory distress that accompanies the virus doesn\'t appear until approximately day 7 of infection, so we need to wait a bit to see what happens now that massive amounts of people have it.  It also seems to trend as being serious virus, about 1000 of the cases (perhaps more, I haven\'t seen the latest numbers) are rated as serious or critical and require hospital care.  That\'s somewhere between 1 out of 6 and 1 out of 7.  We also don\'t know what the infection rate really is because there are reports of it being a carrier but asymptomatic anywhere between 5-14 days.  So the answer is that we don\'t and won\'t know how with certainty how serious it for a bit, and are in wait and see mode.    \n\n\n2) . I have yet to see actual evidence that children and elderly are more likely to develop severe symptoms.  I don\'t know what the age breakdowns are.

Coronavirus,1,"'At least someone is thinking critically.\n\nFDA says that vaccines made from cell lines can contain dormant cancer-causing viruses that can later become active and cause problems.\n\n&gt;Virus-based vaccines are made in living cells (cell substrates). Some manufacturers are investigating the use of new cell lines to make vaccines. The continual growth of cell lines ensures that there is a consistent supply of the same cells that can yield high quantities of the vaccine.\n\n&gt;In some cases the cell lines that are used might be tumorigenic, that is, they form tumors when injected into rodents. Some of these tumor-forming cell lines may contain cancer-causing viruses that are not actively reproducing. Such viruses are hard to detect using standard methods. These latent, or ""quiet,"" viruses pose a potential threat, since they might become active under vaccine manufacturing conditions. Therefore, to ensure the safety of vaccines, our laboratory is investigating ways to activate latent viruses in cell lines and to detect the activated viruses, as well as other unknown viruses, using new technologies. We will then adapt our findings to detect viruses in the same types of cell substrates that are used to produce vaccines. We are also trying to identify specific biological processes that reflect virus activity.\n\n&gt;https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/biologics-research-projects/investigating-viruses-cells-used-make-vaccines-and-evaluating-potential-threat-posed-transmission\n\n\nMore problems with vaccines:\n\n&gt;The Introduction of Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis and Oral Polio Vaccine Among Young Infants in an Urban African Community: A Natural Experiment\n\n&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5360569/\n\n&gt;The 112-Year Odyssey of Pertussis and Pertussis Vaccines-Mistakes Made and Implications for the Future.\n\n&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/30793754/\n\nAnd many many more:\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3878266/\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21623535\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25377033\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24995277\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12145534\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21058170\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22099159\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3364648/\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17454560\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19106436\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3774468/\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3697751/\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21299355\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21907498\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11339848\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17674242\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21993250\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15780490\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12933322\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16870260\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19043938\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12142947\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24675092\n\n\n\nCausal relationship between vaccine induced immunity and autism\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12849883\n\n\n\nSubtle DNA changes and the overuse of vaccines in autism\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3364648/\n\n\n\nVaccine and Autism- a New Scientific Review\n\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/news/vaccines-and-autism-a-new-scientific-review/\n\n\n\nSummary of previous Journal of Immunology\n\nhttp://danmurphydc.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/AR-10-12-rata-AUTISM-VACCINE.pdf\n\n\n\nAutism and Resulting Medical Conditions:http://www.tacanow.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/autism-studies-april-2008.pdf .\n\n\n\nMercury toxic encephalopathy manifesting with clinical symptoms of regressive autistic disorders. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17454560\n\n\n\nRelation of mercury to high autism rates in boys\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16264412\n\n\n\nElevated levels of measles in children with Autism\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12849883\n\n\n\nAbnormal MMR antibodies in children with autism\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12145534\n\n\n\nTylenol, MMR and Autism - A parent survey study\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18445737\n\n\n\nA Positive Association found between Autism Prevalence and Childhood Vaccination\n\nhttp://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/tandf/uteh/2011/00000074/00000014/art00002?token=004c170388ee06a6e5865462431636f5720415d23763c247b5e4e26634a492f2530332976261\n\n\n\nPeer reviewed study on fetal cell contamination with retro virus associated with autism and cancer\n\nhttp://www.globalresearch.ca/new-study-in-journal-of-public-health-finds-autism-and-cancer-related-to-human-fetal-dna-in-vaccines/5402912\n\n\n\nStudy documentation- Dr Deisher\n\nhttp://www.ms.academicjournals.org/article/article1409245960_Deisher%20et%20al.pdf\n\n\n\nAutism and mercury poisoning\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11339848\n\n\n\nHypothesis: conjugate vaccines may predispose children to autism spectrum disorders\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21993250\n\n\n\nRise in autism coincides with rise in vaccines\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21623535\n\n\n\nA two-phase study evaluating the relationship between Thimerosal-containing vaccine administration and the risk for an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis in the United States\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3878266/'",2020-01-30-16
