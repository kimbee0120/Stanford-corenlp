Coronavirus,1,"'Well here\'s my thinking. The people who are getting sick right now are the people who were infected in Wuhan and then came to the United States in the last two weeks. Between the time they landed and the time they were quarentined several days passed and during that time they came into contact with many people. I\'ve seen the infection rate estimated at around 3 so each of those people may have already infected 3 or so people BEFORE being quarentined. Today we have 5 confirmed cases so just a low ball estimate there are today 15 infected, possibly contagious, but otherwise non symptomatic people going about their normal lives infecting their own 3 people. These people will end up in the hospital in the next two weeks however there will then be 45 (15*3) infected and contagious people still out there. Extrapolating this estimate that is multiplies by 3 every 2 weeks there may be 10,000 US cases in 3 months with a million by June/July. Now I am not a scientist of any kind (data or otherwise) and there are many things which can effect this calculation (infection rate, how many people from Wuhan travelled to the US before the quarentine [note probably a lot more than the 5 cases I used in my example] It may miraculously turn out to NOT be contagious before symptoms show, God may deliver a vaccine on angel wings to every KFC this side of the Rio grande etc) but I do think we failed as a species (first China now us as well) in cutting off transportation as soon as possible. If highways/air and train traffic were closed this morning we might only have to deal with cases in major cities but ""this is America"" and judging from how hard the party line today has been ""everything is fine go back to work pray for Kobe ooooohhjj impeachment"" while we are fighting a literal Chinese bio-weapon which had been loose in our country for weeks now is evidence enough for me that the power that be knows how fucked we are and has given up trying to keep us healthy and instead will try to make a little more money before we all get sick. No I don\'t think this will kill all of us but I\'m prepared for tens of millions of deaths in the US alone.

China confirmed the virus mutated already in a month - more rapidly than normal. A virus mutating this quickly would be extremely hard if not impossible to develop a vaccine for.   \n\nThe reason the Novel Corono virus is different from similar viruses in the past is that it is more contagious and can be transmitted during the incubation period - Before symptoms arise. \n\nThey are throwing up two hospitals now over there.  The government in Beijing broadened an extraordinary quarantine to more than 50 million people  roughly equal to the population of Spain  enforcing a travel ban on 16 cities.
